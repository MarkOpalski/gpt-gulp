# Contributing to GPT Gulp

We love your input! We want to make contributing to GPT Gulp as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/MarkOpalski/gpt-gulp/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/MarkOpalski/gpt-gulp/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check if the feature has already been requested
2. Provide a clear description of the problem you're trying to solve
3. Describe the solution you'd like
4. Consider alternative solutions

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run tests: `python test_system.py`

## Code Style

- Use Python 3.8+ features
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate

## Security

Please review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for reporting security vulnerabilities.
